            <h1>Energy</h1>
            <p><strong>Energy</strong> is the ability to perform work, which is the foundation of modern life. Energy is available in various forms such as electricity, heat, movement, and radiation. Energy can be converted from one form to another using certain tools and techniques.</p>
            <h2>Energy is the ability to do work</h2>
            <p>According to the laws of conservation of energy, <q>energy can neither be created nor destroyed but can only be converted from one form to another</q>. The SI unit of energy is Joule.</p>

            <h1>Energy Start</h1>
            <p>Humans have used energy since ancient times. The first human was dependent on the muscular energy of hunting prey and agricultural activities. As civilizations evolved, man began to discover other sources of energy:</p>
            <p>In the 19th century, the use of fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) began widely, especially after the invention of steam machinery.
